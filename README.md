This Python project implements a basic block cipher encryption and decryption system using an S-Box (substitution box) generated from a user-provided 32-character key. The cipher is designed to encrypt and decrypt messages by substituting characters from a defined set, which includes all letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits, and punctuation symbols. The key is used to create a deterministic shuffle of these characters, ensuring consistent encryption and decryption for the same key. The program prompts the user to either encrypt or decrypt a message based on the key, making it a simple yet customizable encryption method.
